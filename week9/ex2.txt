For simplicity, let's consider 3 frames case. For a string:

1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4

We have 0 hits, which is very poor. First reference to the page 4 will replace the oldest page 1, which will call right after, and the same will happen with next pages.

For this string:

1 2 3 4 2 3 4 2 3 4 1 1

We will have solid 7 hits, because we reference pages with the lowest age in memory to force them to stay here.

Summary: the ageing algorithm is not very good algorithm.
